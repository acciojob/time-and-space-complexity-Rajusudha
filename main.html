<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. It allows us to analyze how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the increase in input data. An efficient algorithm is one that can solve a problem with a reasonable amount of time, even as the input size becomes larger. In other words, time complexity helps us compare different algorithms and choose the one that best balances performance and resources.</p>

<p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses during its execution. It evaluates how the memory requirements of an algorithm scale with the input size. In big O notation, which is commonly used to express complexity, space complexity is denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. This means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. Understanding space complexity is crucial for designing algorithms that are memory-efficient and can handle large datasets without causing memory overflows or performance degradation.</p>
